You are handed a "dirty" dataset of Global Temperature Anomaly records (1880–2025). The data contains:

Inconsistent date formats (e.g., "1990/01" and "Jan-1990").

Missing temperature values for specific months.

"Noise" from sensor malfunctions (outliers showing 500).

You must write a script that performs the following:

Standardization: Convert all dates to a uniform datetime object.

Outlier Removal: Use the IQR method discussed to prune the 500errors.

Imputation: Fill missing months using a linear interpolation (a logical step up from the mean imputation ).

create a Dual-Encoded Chart:

Mark: A line representing the temperature over time.

Channel: Color (a Diverging Palette) where blue represents "below average" and red represents "above average" relative to the 20th-century mean.

The final output is a 1-page PDF compiled in LaTeX using IEEE format. It must include:

A Professional Table (booktabs) showing the top 5 warmest years.

An Algebraic Section documenting the normalization used:

 
The Visual Plot exported from Python as a high-resolution .pdf or .png and included via \includegraphics.

Grading Rubric for the Assignment
Criteria	Requirement
Data Integrity	Are the $500^{\circ}C$ outliers removed?
LaTeX Syntax	Does the document compile without errors?
Pipeline Logic	Is the color encoding used effectively for the anomaly?
Math Formatting	Are the formulas typeset in "Display Math" mode?
